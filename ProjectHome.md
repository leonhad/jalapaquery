Welcome to Jalapaquery's homepage! Jalapaquery is a QT based modeling tool for GNU/Linux, MacOS X and Windows environments. Jalapaquery is being developed under the GNU GPL v3 license.

Initially, our approach will be to develop a user friendly interface tool for creating Entity-Relationship models. At first, we intend to work with physical models and we will focus on the ability to create specific models for different database management systems, such as Oracle, PostgreSQL or MySQL. Once complete we will work with logical models. The complete version will be able to connect with databases to create models by reverse engineering.

Jalapaquery will be able to save and load information on XML gzipped files, create pdf files for each model and print them on various page sizes. There will be advanced features for saving informations on a database so that it can work as a ditributed system, centering all models for an organization in a single location.

Further development will focus on the possibility of creating a CASE tool. This will take advantage the knowledge gained in early releases and add functionality to the existing codebase. The environment to create UML models will be designed with the same technology involved in the ER modeling tool, and both could figure together in a single modeling suite of tools.

The proofs of concept are complete and we have identified the technologies required to implement this project. There is a first beta prototype available in the source code area. Download the code, compile and try it! Tell us what you think on our mailing list at [Google Groups jalapaquery-discuss](http://groups.google.com/group/jalapaquery-discuss)
